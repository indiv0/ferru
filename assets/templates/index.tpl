            <p>Hi, my name is Nikita Pekin.</p>
            <p>I'm a developer.</p>
            <p>I mostly work on hobbyist Java/web programming projects, like my <a href="https://github.com/Indiv0/indiv0.github.io/">website</a>, game-related <a href="https://github.com/Indiv0/launchcraft">endeavours</a>, and other miscellaneous stuff like my Arch Linux <a href="https://github.com/Indiv0/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>.</p>
            <p>On my website I mostly write rants, discuss my projects, and experiment.</p>
            <p>I'm currently studing undergraduate Computer Engineering at the University of Ottawa.</p>
