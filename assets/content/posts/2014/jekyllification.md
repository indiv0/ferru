summary: Using Jekyll themes with Flask

So I decided to re-design my site (again) and this time I decided to use the [Hyde](http://andhyde.com/) theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

I chose it because it was a minimalist, simple theme that could easily be used to display my entire site.
I got the idea after seeing [fak3r's](https://fak3r.com/) site.

Obviously I had to adapt it for Flask, as Jekyll is intended to build static blogs on Ruby.
