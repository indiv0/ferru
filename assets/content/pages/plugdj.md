### Points ###
Points are obtained either when someone gives you a "Woot!" while you are playing a song, or when you "Woot!" a song.

You can use these points to unlock avatars, and feel better about yourself.


### Woot! ###
A "Woot!" is a symbol of approval of a song, akin to an upvote on reddit.

You can "Woot!" a song by clicking the large green "Woot!" button to the right of the DJ Booth.


### Meh ###
A "Meh" is a symbol of disapproval of a song, akin to an downvote on reddit.

You can "Meh!" a song by clicking the large red "Meh" button to the left of the DJ Booth.


### Featured DJ ###
A featured DJ is someone who the moderators of the room have promoted to "Featured DJ" status.

Featured DJ status carries no benefits except for a purple name in the chat, and the ability to play during closed DJ sets.

The MinerApocalypse plug.dj room does not have featured DJs.
